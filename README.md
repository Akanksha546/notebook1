Code Snippets on Image Processing (Computer Vision)
1) Thresholding (Binary Thresholding) â€“ A fundamental technique in segmentation that converts grayscale images into binary (black and white) based on a threshold value.Your code applies thresholding, which is a type of point operation in image processing. Specifically, you're using binary thresholding, where pixel values above a certain threshold (200 in your case) are set to 255 (white), and the rest are set to 0 (black).
   
2) The type of image processing used in 2nd is Gamma Correction, which is a form of point-wise intensity transformation.                                                               Use Cases of Gamma Correction:
Enhancing Dark or Bright Images: Low gamma values (<1) brighten dark images, while high gamma values (>1) darken bright images.
Correcting Display Response: Some displays have nonlinear brightness responses, which gamma correction helps to correct.

3) The 3rd image processing technique used is Contrast Stretching, also known as Normalization or Piecewise Linear Contrast Enhancement.Contrast stretching is a point processing technique, meaning it modifies the pixel intensity values independently without considering neighboring pixels.
How It Works
Contrast stretching enhances an image by increasing the dynamic range of pixel intensity values. It uses a piecewise linear transformation function to map input intensity levels to new values, effectively improving the contrast of an image.
