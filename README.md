Code Snippets on Image Processing (Computer Vision)
1) Thresholding (Binary Thresholding) â€“ A fundamental technique in segmentation that converts grayscale images into binary (black and white) based on a threshold value.Your code applies thresholding, which is a type of point operation in image processing. Specifically, you're using binary thresholding, where pixel values above a certain threshold (200 in your case) are set to 255 (white), and the rest are set to 0 (black).
