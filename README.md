Code Snippets on Image Processing (Computer Vision)
1) Thresholding (Binary Thresholding) â€“ A fundamental technique in segmentation that converts grayscale images into binary (black and white) based on a threshold value.Your code applies thresholding, which is a type of point operation in image processing. Specifically, you're using binary thresholding, where pixel values above a certain threshold (200 in your case) are set to 255 (white), and the rest are set to 0 (black).
   
2) The type of image processing used in 2nd is Gamma Correction, which is a form of point-wise intensity transformation.                                                               Use Cases of Gamma Correction:
Enhancing Dark or Bright Images: Low gamma values (<1) brighten dark images, while high gamma values (>1) darken bright images.
Correcting Display Response: Some displays have nonlinear brightness responses, which gamma correction helps to correct.
